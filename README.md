# evogrid

## Overview

This project is a simulation of evolving organisms in a grid environment, aiming to study artificial intelligence through evolutionary mechanisms. Organisms move, eat, reproduce, and interact in an environment, driven by a neural network. Their behaviors and interactions can evolve over time through genetic algorithms.

### Features

- **Neural Network-driven Organisms**: Each organism's behavior is controlled by a neural network, determining its movements, eating habits, and other interactions.
  
- **Evolution Through Reproduction**: Successful organisms reproduce, passing on their traits to the next generation. This process involves mechanisms like mutation and even sexual reproduction with mixing traits.

- **UI for Real-time Parameter Adjustments**: A user interface with sliders allows on-the-fly adjustments to various simulation parameters.

- **Responsive Design**: The simulation adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cbrincoveanu/evogrid.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd evogrid
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a browser to run the simulation.

## Usage

1. **Sliders**: Use the sliders on the right to adjust various simulation parameters like speed, mutation rate, etc.
2. **Canvas**: The left side displays the grid where organisms interact. Each organism's color, size, or shape might indicate its energy, age, or other properties.

## Future Work

- Integrate reinforcement learning mechanisms.
- Improve efficiency and speed of the simulation for larger grids or populations.
- Explore different neural network architectures.
