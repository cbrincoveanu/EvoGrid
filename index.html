            <h3>About EvoGrid</h3>
            <p>
                EvoGrid is a simulation designed to study artificial intelligence and its evolution. Using neural networks, each organism determines its behavior, from movement to feeding habits. The most fascinating part? Watching them adapt and change over generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project is a blend of genetic algorithms and neural network architectures, giving insights into how intelligence might emerge and evolve. Use the sliders on the right to tweak various parameters and see how the organisms adapt.
            </p>
            <h4>Future Directions</h4>
            <p>
                This simulation is just the beginning. Future integrations may include reinforcement learning mechanisms, more complex neural network models, and a broader exploration of evolutionary mechanisms.
